Professor Pusheen Q. WeatherCat

Original Goals
* Show the weather based on geolocation with the option for the user to search for a specific location.
* Allow the user to change temperature units between Fahrenheit and Celsius. 
* Change the background and Pusheen's outfit to match the weather. 
* Make the design responsive and generally nice-looking.

Possible future enhancements
* Use a location-by-IP api as a secondary geolocation service.
* Hide the "use current location" button for browsers in which it will not work.
* Pick a location to default to when geolocation doesn't work.
* Rearrange on mobile a bit to show all of Pusheen in the initial view, using some smallish standard phone-screen size to jusdge that (iPhone 4?).
